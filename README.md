To run our three tasks, double-click the .exe's labelled "astar" "aabb" or "ss" respectively. Use a 1024x768 resolution.

In the astar example, use wasd to move the red player cube. If the player cube or either of the AI cubes get stuck upon generation of the level, hit f5 to re-generate the level.

In the aabb and ss examples, use w and s to move forward and backward, a and d to move side to side, and q and e to move up and down.

In all three examples, use alt+f4 to exit out of the game.
